Release history
===============

0.4.0  --  12 Feb 2014
    - Properly renamed project name in comment headers.
    - Renamed core module to core.v.
    - Added collision.vh include guards.
    - Updated display controller to accept variable timing parameters.
    - Added token audio output.
    - Fixed typo in mem_sck name.
    - Increased VRAM size to 512 kB.
    - Register writes use system clock.
    - Added enable flags for 8-bit mode and flipping to tile registers.
    - Allow tile/sprite register decoders to address more than 64 kB of VRAM.
    - Removed CPLD code, as DuinoCube no longer uses a CPLD.

0.3.0  --   4 Nov 2013
    - Added collision detection buffers, registers, and table.
    - Added an alias of the sprite location registers so they are contiguously
      mapped.  This allows fast access using the SPI interface.  They are mapped
      in the order: X0, Y0, X1, Y1, ... , X255, Y255.
    - Optimization of memory read output selection to make the path shorter.
    - Moved tile registers from 0x800 to 0x100 for easier output selection.
    - Removed latching of data out to avoid race condition.

0.2.0  --   2 Oct 2013
    First DuinoCube release.
    - Added Arduino Uno module.
        = Uses SPI bus.
        = Has dual-port multiplexed SPI buses.
        = Internally still the same as the pre-Arduino ChronoCube core.
    - Updated registers to match latest design doc.
    - Sprite Z-level support.  Not well-tested.
    - Unmapped memory reads as "0xdead".
    - Reduced bus sizes of various local buses in renderer, to reduce logic
      requirements.

0.1.0  --  12 May 2013
    Initial release version.  Has the following features:

    - 320x240 video mode, 8 bits per pixel.
    - Four 256 color palettes.
    - Read-only registers to get ID and video output status.
    - 16-bit address bus multiplex with 8-bit address bus.
        = First 16-KB block is regular memory space.
        = Second 16-KB block is bank switchable to extended internal address
          space.
        = Third and fourth 16-KB blocks are undefined.
    - Universal camera scrolling relative to world coordinates.
    - Four tile layers in fixed Z-order.
        = Each layer shares one palette.
        = Each tile layer is 32x32 tiles.
        = Each tile is 16x16 pixels.
        = Each entry of the tilemap is 16 bits.
        = Tiles can be flipped horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
        = Tiles support color key-based transparency.
        = Tiles are scrollable in world coordinates.
    - One sprite layer containing all sprites.  Z-order is adjustable relative
      to tile layers.
        = Maximum of 128 sprites.
        = Each sprite can have dimensions of 8, 16, 32, and 64 pixels.
        = Each sprite uses one of the four palettes.
        = Sprites can be flipped horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
        = Sprites support color key-based transparency.
        = Sprites are scrollable in either world or screen coordinates.
    - Supports up to 64 KB of VRAM for image data.
