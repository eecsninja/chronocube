Release history
===============

0.2.0  --   2 Oct 2013
    First DuinoCube release.
    - Added Arduino Uno module.
        = Uses SPI bus.
        = Has dual-port multiplexed SPI buses.
        = Internally still the same as the pre-Arduino ChronoCube core.
    - Updated registers to match latest design doc.
    - Sprite Z-level support.  Not well-tested.
    - Unmapped memory reads as "0xdead".
    - Reduced bus sizes of various local buses in renderer, to reduce logic
      requirements.

0.1.0  --  12 May 2013
    Initial release version.  Has the following features:

    - 320x240 video mode, 8 bits per pixel.
    - Four 256 color palettes.
    - Read-only registers to get ID and video output status.
    - 16-bit address bus multiplex with 8-bit address bus.
        = First 16-KB block is regular memory space.
        = Second 16-KB block is bank switchable to extended internal address
          space.
        = Third and fourth 16-KB blocks are undefined.
    - Universal camera scrolling relative to world coordinates.
    - Four tile layers in fixed Z-order.
        = Each layer shares one palette.
        = Each tile layer is 32x32 tiles.
        = Each tile is 16x16 pixels.
        = Each entry of the tilemap is 16 bits.
        = Tiles can be flipped horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
        = Tiles support color key-based transparency.
        = Tiles are scrollable in world coordinates.
    - One sprite layer containing all sprites.  Z-order is adjustable relative
      to tile layers.
        = Maximum of 128 sprites.
        = Each sprite can have dimensions of 8, 16, 32, and 64 pixels.
        = Each sprite uses one of the four palettes.
        = Sprites can be flipped horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
        = Sprites support color key-based transparency.
        = Sprites are scrollable in either world or screen coordinates.
    - Supports up to 64 KB of VRAM for image data.
