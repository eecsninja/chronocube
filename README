ChronoCube
==========

An FPGA-based design for generating 2D video game graphics.

The current HDL code is ready to be built for Altera Cyclone IV E FPGA's.  For
other Altera FPGA's and FPGA's of other brands, some extra work may be necessary
to build ChronoCube.

ChronoCube was developed on a Cyclone IV EP4CE6 FPGA.
